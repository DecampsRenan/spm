## About

Ever joined a project and had to check which package manager it uses before running anything? Yeah, us too. 😅

**spm** detects your project's package manager automatically and translates your commands on the fly. Just type `spm install`, `spm add react`, or `spm dev` — it handles the rest.

- 🔍 **Auto-detection** via lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- 📂 **Directory walk-up** — works from any subdirectory in your project
- 🔄 **Command translation** — maps commands to the correct syntax for each package manager
- 💬 **Interactive prompt** when multiple lock files are detected
- 👀 **Dry-run mode** to preview commands without executing them
- 🎵 **Vibes mode** — play background music while installing dependencies (`--vibes`)
- 🔔 **Notification sounds** — get notified when the command finishes (`--notify`)

### Built With

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- [Beep](https://github.com/gopxl/beep)

## Getting Started

### Install script (macOS / Linux)

The fastest way to get started:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/decampsrenan/spm/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Want to install to a custom directory? No problem:

```sh
INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/decampsrenan/spm/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### From source

Requires [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.25+.

```sh
go install github.com/decampsrenan/spm@latest
```

## Usage

```sh
# Install dependencies (auto-detects npm/yarn/pnpm)
spm install

# Add a package
spm add react

# Add a dev dependency
spm add vitest --save-dev

# Run a script defined in package.json
spm dev
spm test
spm build

# Preview what would run without executing
spm dev --dry-run

# Install with background music 🎶
spm install --vibes

# Play a sound when the command finishes
spm install --notify

# Combine vibes and notification
spm install --vibes --notify

# Show version
spm --version
spm -v
```

### Command mapping

| spm command   | npm               | yarn            | pnpm            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `spm install` | `npm install`     | `yarn install`  | `pnpm install`  |
| `spm add foo` | `npm install foo` | `yarn add foo`  | `pnpm add foo`  |
| `spm dev`     | `npm run dev`     | `yarn dev`      | `pnpm dev`      |
